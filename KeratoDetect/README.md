# KeratoDetect: Keratoconus Detection Algorithm Using Convolutional Neural Networks
The proposed project aims to aid the detection of keratoconus.
CNN is described in this [paper ](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2019/8162567/)

The files are inside the cnn_kt folder.
To run, just open a terminal and enter the command __pyhton keratodetect.py__.
